In a shadowy underground cavern, a blond, unhelmeted warrior stands in black armor with amber trim. He has just thrown his round medieval shield with his right arm. The shield is flying parallel to the ground, slightly below shoulder height, and has just bisected a glowing green tentacle â€” the severed end is flailing mid-air as ichor or magical energy bursts from the cut.\n\nTwo tentacles are reaching directly toward the champion, one of which is the one being cut. The tentacles are thick, luminous green, magical in nature (no suckers), and coil unnaturally with energy. The background features a distant purple obelisk carved with glowing orange runes, now pushed slightly back in the scene to show space between the champion and the monolith.\n\nStyle & lighting: (high fantasy scene), dynamic lighting with sharp highlights and deep shadows, richly saturated color palette, vivid greens and reds contrasting with natural earth tones, theatrical lighting like a stage spotlight, subtle magical glow effects, atmospheric depth with layered fog or light shafts, backlit figures with rim lighting, vibrant but grounded, cinematic tone.\n\nThe characterâ€™s pose reflects a forceful right-arm throw, feet grounded, left hand trailing behind for balance. The shield is rotated ~15Â° left to appear more perpendicular to the ground. Emphasize cinematic action, painterly texture, and dynamic movement within the frame."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":27,"type":"EmptySD3LatentImage","pos":[430,590],"size":[315,106],"flags":{},"order":3,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"width","name":"width","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"width"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"height","name":"height","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"height"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"batch_size","name":"batch_size","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"batch_size"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"LATENT","name":"LATENT","type":"LATENT","slot_index":0,"links":[51]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.56","Node name for S&R":"EmptySD3LatentImage"},"widgets_values":[1280,1648,1],"color":"#323","bgcolor":"#535"}],"links":[[9,8,0,9,0,"IMAGE"],[45,30,1,6,0,"CLIP"],[46,30,2,8,1,"VAE"],[47,30,0,31,0,"MODEL"],[51,27,0,31,3,"LATENT"],[52,31,0,8,0,"LATENT"],[54,30,1,33,0,"CLIP"],[55,33,0,31,2,"CONDITIONING"],[58,6,0,31,1,"CONDITIONING"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1.0483068613685378,"offset":[84.8116399101147,10.039164074184285]}},"version":0.4}
