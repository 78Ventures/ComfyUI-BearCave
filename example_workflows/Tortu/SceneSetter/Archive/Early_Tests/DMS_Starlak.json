A warforged warlock dressed in pirate garb stands inside a misty underground jungle cavern. He wears a long, dark red coat with brass accents, a navy tricorn hat, and layered adventuring gear. His metallic face is expressive and subtly lit by glowing green eldritch energy flickering in his raised hand. Perched on his shoulder is a small blue ring octopus, its skin shifting in hues of bright blue and purple with subtle green undertones â€” as if reacting to the arcane energy.\n\nThe warlock faces a massive black dragon-serpent â€” a huge black rattlesnake-like creature with draconic features. Its body coils defensively, covered in jagged, gleaming black scales. Small horns rise behind its glowing yellow eyes, and its expression is intelligent, watchful, and aggressive but not yet attacking.\n\nThe confrontation is tense but nonviolent â€” a negotiation filled with barely restrained danger.\n\nVisual style:\nHigh fantasy scene with dynamic lighting, sharp highlights and deep shadows. The color palette is richly saturated, with vivid greens and reds contrasting against natural earth tones. The scene is lit like a stage, with theatrical lighting that creates drama and focus. Subtle magical glow effects play across surfaces, and atmospheric depth is achieved through layered fog and light shafts. Figures are backlit, with rim lighting outlining their silhouettes. The overall tone is cinematic, vibrant but grounded, evoking the feeling of a critical moment in an epic tale."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"}],"links":[[9,8,0,9,0,"IMAGE"],[45,30,1,6,0,"CLIP"],[46,30,2,8,1,"VAE"],[47,30,0,31,0,"MODEL"],[51,27,0,31,3,"LATENT"],[52,31,0,8,0,"LATENT"],[58,6,0,31,1,"CONDITIONING"],[59,38,0,31,2,"CONDITIONING"],[60,30,1,38,0,"CLIP"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1.0483068613685378,"offset":[56.57041604618729,23.349317345321456]}},"version":0.4}
